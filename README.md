# Todo list - React App

This was done using ❤️

## Project

In the project, we have:

### `Features`

1. We will take todos with the text input and a button to get it registered.\
2. When ever the task is done we can click on the radio button as completed.
3. There is a button to remove the todo which are done.
4. There is a live count which tells us the todo left to be completed.
5. Our website will keep track of all the todos we registered, we will can reload to check wheather it's storing in the local_storage or not.

**Note: this is just a website made as a `practice`, towards REACT!**

## More

destructing array is used.

### Things Used

We have used UseState, UseRef, UseEffect

Moreover we use uuid for making random unique id's so that the todos stay unique.
